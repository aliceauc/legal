# Privacy Policy for Atsuko Bot
*Last Updated: [September 29, 2024]*

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Atsuko ("the bot") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the bot. By using Atsuko, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect
Atsuko collects the following information from users:
- **Discord User ID**: Used to identify individual users as a substitute for an account registration system.
- **Discord Avatar**: Used to personalize user interactions.
- **Discord Guild ID**: Used to identify and personalize interactions within specific guilds (servers).

Additionally, Atsuko uses Discord **Intents** related to guild and guild members to track events, such as server boosting, to provide boost notifications. However, no other member-specific or sensitive data are stored.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
The information collected by Atsuko is used solely for the following purposes:
- **User Identification**: The Discord User ID is used to differentiate between users and enable personalized interactions.
- **Personalization**: The Discord Avatar is used to enhance the user experience during interactions with the bot.
- **Guild Identification**: The Discord Guild ID is used to differentiate between guilds for personalized interactions and server-specific features.
- **Event Notifications**: Discord intents are used to track events like boosting, allowing the bot to provide real-time notifications for such events.

We do **not** sell, share, or otherwise distribute this information to third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
Atsuko stores only the necessary data mentioned above and operates primarily on the Discord platform. Most data is processed in real-time and exists only for the duration of the user’s interaction with the bot. As a result, there is minimal long-term storage of user information.

We take reasonable precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or disclosure. However, because Atsuko operates within the Discord platform, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data as Discord's own policies and infrastructure govern much of the security.

## 5. Premium Features and User Responsibility
Users who subscribe to Atsuko's premium features, such as club registration and progress tracking, are responsible for the accuracy of the data they input. Atsuko does not verify or validate this data, and it is up to the user to ensure the correctness of any submitted information.

## 6. Data Responsibility
Atsuko is responsible for providing accurate Blue Archive game data. However, users are responsible for any personal data or club-related information they input while using the premium features.

## 7. User Rights
You have the right to request that we stop using your data at any time. To do so, please contact us through our support server. However, note that Atsuko’s ability to function may be limited if user data (e.g., Discord ID or Guild ID) is removed or altered.

## 8. Changes to the Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and it is your responsibility to review this page periodically for any updates. Your continued use of Atsuko after changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the changes.

## 9. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, please contact our team via [Atsuko Support](https://discord.gg/pxc4UvdPQA).
