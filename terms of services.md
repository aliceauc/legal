This information is used solely to identify users within the bot as there is no formal account registration system. Users who subscribe to premium features are responsible for the validity and accuracy of any data they input, such as club membership and progress data. Atsuko is not responsible for verifying the accuracy of this user-inputted data. However, all game-related information provided by the bot is Atsuko's responsibility, and users are encouraged to suggest corrections if any discrepancies are found.

## 3. Game Information and Responsibility
Atsuko strives to provide accurate and up-to-date information about Blue Archive. While the bot takes responsibility for ensuring the correctness of in-game data, users are encouraged to provide suggestions or corrections if any errors are found.

## 5. Premium Features
Atsuko offers premium subscription features, specifically allowing clubs (guilds) to register members and track their progress for easier management. These features are subject to a subscription plan. Premium users must comply with the same rules as non-premium users.
